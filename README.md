# OpenGL HelloWorld Triangle

This is a basic VisualStudio 2017 C++ template for getting OpenGl running with GLFW and GLEW. It generates a Triangle in a 640x480 window.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This uses the GLFW and GLEW win32 includes and libraries.

```
- Visual Studio 2017
- GLFW (included in /Dependencies)
- GLEW (included in /Dependencies)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Opening in Visual Studio

```
Load the 'OpenGL.sln' project file in Visual Studio 2017
```

Link the Dependencies

```
Right click the project title, go to 'Properties' and make sure all includes and libraries from /Dependencies are linked correctly
```

## Running the project

Either run the 'OpenGL.exe' file in (/Debug) or compile and run the project file in Visual Studio 2017.
